        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I am a Peace Corps Volunteer and a recent graduate of UC Davis. I love working in the overlap between environmental science and technology. I love visualizing data through GIS and code, and developing tools to ease the work of other people.</p> 
        <p>Outside of work, I like long walks in the forest and spending time with my partner, my family, and my friends. I like traveling to places that expand my tiny view of the world.</p>
